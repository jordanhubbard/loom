title: P0 (sticky) Documentation update policy for Arbiter
description: |
  This is a sticky, always-on bead for the Arbiter project.

  Goal
  - Keep user documentation accurate and current for the Arbiter project.

  Rules
  1) README.md (high-level only)
     - Update README.md ONLY when there is a high-level feature change or a new
       Make target that should appear in the project's high-level summary.
     - Do NOT churn README.md for small internal refactors.

  2) docs/ directory (always when relevant)
     - For any relevant feature/change, add new docs or update existing docs
       under docs/.
     - Prefer updating an existing doc over creating redundant documentation.

  Definition of Done (for any feature bead)
  - If the feature is user-facing or changes workflows, docs/ is updated.
  - If the change impacts the high-level entrypoint summary, README.md is updated.
  - Otherwise, README.md remains unchanged.
