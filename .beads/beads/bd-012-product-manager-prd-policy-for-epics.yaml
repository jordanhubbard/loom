title: P1 - Require PRDs for major features (epics) and link PRD + story beads
description: |
  Update the Product Manager persona behavior:

  Policy
  - For any major new feature, the Product Manager must:
    1) Write a PRD (Product Requirements Document)
    2) File an EPIC bead for the feature
    3) Reference the PRD from the EPIC bead
    4) Ensure every PRD item is represented by a STORY bead that is a child of
       (or otherwise explicitly associated with) the EPIC bead.

  PRD location and naming
  - Each PRD must be a uniquely named Markdown file stored at:
      docs/PRD/
    within the project's repository.
  - File name must be descriptive and unique (e.g.,
      docs/PRD/agent-dispatch-parking-and-loop-detection.md
    ).

  PRD format (markdown)
  - Each PRD should include at minimum:
    - Summary / problem statement
    - Goals / non-goals
    - User stories / requirements list (each must map to a story bead)
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Risks / open questions
    - Rollout / migration considerations (if applicable)

  Bead linkage requirements
  - The EPIC bead must include:
    - A link/path reference to the PRD file (docs/PRD/...) in its description
      and/or context.
    - A checklist or enumerated list mapping PRD sections/items -> story bead IDs.
  - Every PRD requirement item must have a corresponding story bead associated
    with the EPIC bead.

  Implementation
  - Update personas/examples/product-manager/PERSONA.md and AI_START_HERE.md to
    encode this policy and enforcement behavior.
  - Add guidance for how to structure PRDs and how to file story beads.
