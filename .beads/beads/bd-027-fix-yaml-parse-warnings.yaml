title: P0 - Fix remaining bead YAML parse warnings
description: |
  Resolve the remaining YAML parse warnings emitted on startup when loading
  bead files. These warnings are currently preventing those beads from loading
  cleanly.

  Context
  - Warnings observed after `make build run`:
    - bd-008-add-ceo-persona-tiebreak-deadlock-workflow.yaml: cannot unmarshal !!seq into string
    - bd-009-temporal-clock-dispatch-loop-detection-and-parking.yaml: cannot unmarshal !!seq into string
    - bd-013-readme-personas-and-project-registration-docs.yaml: cannot unmarshal !!seq into string
    - bd-018-ui-provider-model-status.yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context
    - bd-020-model-negotiation-tests.yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context
    - bd-026-fix-build-target-model-catalog-key.yaml: mapping values are not allowed in this context

  Requirements
  - Update the listed bead YAML files so they parse without warnings.
  - Preserve the semantic content of each bead.
  - Ensure `make build run` loads all beads without YAML parse warnings.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - No YAML parse warnings on startup for the listed bead files.
  - Beads load successfully and retain their original intent.
