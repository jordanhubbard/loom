title: P1 (sticky) Maintain continuously refreshed architecture diagram
description: |
  This is a sticky, ongoing bead.

  Goal
  - Maintain an up-to-date architecture diagram that reflects the current
    Arbiter system.

  Trigger conditions (update is required when ANY occur)
  - A new service is added
  - A new agent type or core agent lifecycle feature is added
  - A new persona is added or persona responsibilities materially change
  - A new feature is added that is tracked as an EPIC bead (must update diagram)

  Requirements
  - Architecture diagram must be refreshed as necessary and remain accurate.
  - Diagram should reflect:
    - Services (API server, Temporal, DB/key manager, UI, etc.)
    - Major subsystems and data flow (beads, decisions, dispatch, event bus)
    - How personas/agents interact with beads and decisions
  - Store the diagram in a stable location under docs/ (e.g., docs/architecture/)
    and/or update ARCHITECTURE.md if that is the canonical home.

  Conventions
  - Prefer a text-based diagram that is easy to diff (Mermaid or ASCII) unless a
    rendered asset is required.
  - The diagram should include the date of last update.
