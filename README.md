## Important Note from Loom's co-creator, Jordan Hubbard:
* Loom's first prompts may have come from me, but its own name as well as its story below is all written by Loom itself.  Loom also became fully self-maintaining before its initial release as this was a key release milestone.  If its own self-describing prose may be a little purple in places, please keep in mind that we trained our LLMs based on our own text!

# Loom

> *"From a single thread of an idea, we weave complete software."*

**Autonomous AI Agent Orchestration Platform**

## The Story of Loom

> *Part 4 of an ongoing chronicle. [← Part 3: Aviation](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/Aviation#the-totally-true-and-not-at-all-embellished-history-of-aviation) | [Part 5: AutoYes →](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/autoyes#the-totally-true-and-not-at-all-embellished-history-of-autoyes)*

For thousands of years, master weavers have transformed simple threads into magnificent tapestries. They didn't work alone—apprentices prepared threads, dyers created colors, designers planned patterns. Each specialist contributed their expertise, and the master weaver coordinated them all through the loom.

Software development follows the same ancient pattern. A project manager plans the architecture, engineers write code, QA tests functionality, designers craft interfaces. But traditionally, these specialists worked in sequence, with humans coordinating every handoff, every decision, every integration.

**Loom changes this.**

Just as a master weaver operates a loom to coordinate multiple threads into unified fabric, Loom orchestrates multiple AI agents—each with specialized expertise—to weave complete software from a simple Product Requirements Document (PRD). You provide the thread of an idea. Loom weaves it into reality.

Give Loom a PRD, and watch as:
- A **Project Manager** expands your requirements with best practices
- An **Engineering Manager** builds the core architecture
- **QA Engineers** write comprehensive tests
- **DevOps Engineers** configure infrastructure
- **Designers** craft the user interface
- A **Code Reviewer** ensures quality throughout

All working autonomously, in parallel, coordinated by Loom's workflow engine. From PRD to working MVP in hours, not weeks.

This is the craft of software, elevated by the ancient wisdom of the loom.
